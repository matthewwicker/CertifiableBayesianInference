# Certifiable Bayesian Inference
### Code for paper "Bayesian Inference with Certified Adversarial Robustness"

This code contains the custom inference and analysis methods for inferring certifiable 
Bayesian posterior distributions for deep neural networks. 

* This is an inital push of the code. There will be a walk through for reproducability later.
